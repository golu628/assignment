        "Ordinal Encoding:\n",
        "\n",
        "Assigns numerical values to categories that reflect their inherent order.\n",
        "Useful when categories have a natural ranking or sequence (e.g., customer satisfaction: very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied, very satisfied).\n",
        "Preserves the order information for the model.\n",
        "Label Encoding:\n",
        "\n",
        "Assigns arbitrary integer values to each unique category.\n",
        "Simpler to implement, but treats categories as independent, potentially misleading the model if order matters.\n",
        "Suitable for nominal categorical variables with no inherent order (e.g., colors: red, green, blue).\n",
        "Choosing Between Ordinal and Label Encoding:\n",
        "\n",
        "Use ordinal encoding when the categories have a natural order that's relevant to the prediction task.\n",
        "Use label encoding when the categories are nominal and order doesn't matter, or when dealing with a large number of categories to avoid dimensionality explosion.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider a dataset with customer ratings (1-star, 2-star, 3-star, 4-star, 5-star). Ordinal encoding would be appropriate as these ratings have a clear order. Label encoding could also work here, but it wouldn't capture the inherent order of the ratings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. Target Guided Ordinal Encoding\n",
        "\n",
        "Leverages the target variable's relationship with the categorical feature.\n",
        "Calculates a statistic (e.g., mean, median) of the target variable for each category.\n",
        "Sorts categories based on this statistic and assigns numerical values based on the ranking.\n",
        "Improves model performance when categories have a significant impact on the target variable.\n",
        "Using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
        "\n",
        "When you suspect a categorical feature might influence the target variable in a specific order.\n",
        "To potentially improve model accuracy compared to traditional ordinal encoding.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine a dataset with customer purchase history (low, medium, high) and product category. Target-guided ordinal encoding could reveal that categories with higher average purchase amounts are ranked higher.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. Covariance\n",
        "\n",
        "Measures the linear relationship between two continuous variables.\n",
        "A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to move in the same direction (higher values for both or lower values for both).\n",
        "A negative covariance indicates that the variables tend to move in opposite directions (higher value for one corresponds to a lower value for the other).\n",
        "A zero covariance suggests no linear relationship between the variables.\n",
        "Importance in Statistical Analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "Helps assess the direction and strength of the relationship between variables.\n",
        "Crucial for techniques like correlation analysis and regression modeling."
