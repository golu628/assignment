        "Traditional Hosting:\n",
        "\n",
        "You rent physical server space from a hosting provider.\n",
        "You have limited control over the server environment.\n",
        "Scalability is difficult and requires manual server upgrades.\n",
        "Maintenance and security patches are the provider's responsibility (mostly).\n",
        "Cloud Hosting:\n",
        "\n",
        "You rent virtual server space and resources on-demand from a cloud provider.\n",
        "Offers high scalability (easily adjust resources up or down).\n",

        "Q3. Choosing a Cloud Provider:\n",
        "Factors to Consider:\n",
        "\n",
        "Pricing: Compare pricing models and resource costs across different providers.\n",
        "Services Offered: Choose a provider that offers the services you need (e.g., databases, storage, managed services).\n",
        "Scalability: Ensure the provider offers easy scaling options for your application's growth.\n",
        "Security: Evaluate the provider's security practices and compliance certifications.\n",
        "Reliability: Consider the provider's uptime record and disaster recovery options.\n",
        "Region Availability: Choose a provider with servers in regions close to your target audience (for better performance).\n",

        "Best Practices:\n",
        "\n",
        "Mobile-First Design: Design for smaller screens first and adapt for larger screens.\n",
        "Responsive Layouts: Use CSS media queries to adjust layout based on screen size.\n",
        "Fluid Grid System: Use a flexible grid system to arrange UI elements responsively.\n",
        "Responsive Images and Videos: Use images and videos that adapt to different screen sizes.\n",
        "Usability Testing: Test your UI on various devices and browsers for optimal experience.\n",

        "Flask or Django (Python): Backend frameworks for building APIs to access the model's predictions.\n",
        "TensorFlow.js or PyTorch.js: JavaScript libraries that allow running machine learning models in the browser.\n",
        "RESTful API: Design an API endpoint that receives user input (e.g., satellite image data) and returns the model's prediction (fire risk level).\n",
        "Frontend Frameworks (React, Angular): Use these frameworks to build the user interface and interact with the backend API for predictions.\n",
        "Here's a possible approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "Develop a backend API using Flask or Django that takes user input (e.g., image upload) and preprocesses it for the model.\n",
        "Use TensorFlow.js or PyTorch.js to convert your trained model for in-browser use.\n",
        "Design a user interface where users can upload satellite images.\n",
        "Upon image upload, use JavaScript to send the image data to the backend API.\n",
        "The backend API preprocesses the image, feeds it to the converted model, and returns the prediction.\n",
