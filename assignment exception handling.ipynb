    "1.n Python, an Exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program’s instructions. Exceptions are known as deviations from the normal behavior of the program. They occur when an error occurs, such as a division by zero, a file not found, or a network connection lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Syntax Errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most common kind of complaint you get while you are still learning Python. They occur when the parser detects a syntactic anomaly in your code, essentially when it doesn’t understand what you’re saying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key differences between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Occurrence: Syntax errors occur when the program is parsed, i.e., before the program is run. Exceptions occur during the execution of the program.\n",
    "Handling: Syntax errors cannot be handled, but exceptions can be caught and handled using try/except blocks in Python.\n",
    "Examples: A missing parenthesis, or using a reserved keyword for a variable name, will result in syntax errors. On the other hand, trying to open a non-existent file, or trying to divide a number by zero, will result in exceptions.\n",
    "Remember, while syntax errors are fatal and lead to the termination of the program, exceptions, if not handled, lead to the termination of the program, but they can be programmatically intercepted and handled."

    "2.When an exception is not handled in Python, it causes the program to stop executing and displays an error message. This is known as an unhandled exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide_numbers(num1, num2):\n",
    "    return num1 / num2\n",
    "\n",
    "print(divide_numbers(5, 0))\n",
    "AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.\n",
    "In this code, we’re trying to divide a number by zero, which is not allowed in mathematics. This will raise a ZeroDivisionError exception. Since we have not included any code to handle this exception (using try/except), the program will stop executing at the line where the exception occurred and will print an error message similar to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 2, in divide_numbers\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "This output is showing us the “traceback” to the line of code where the unhandled exception occurred, along with the type of exception (ZeroDivisionError) and a message explaining what caused the exception (division by zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "If this exception were in a larger, more complex program, the abrupt termination could cause the program to stop functioning properly, or it could result in the loss of unsaved work. That’s why it’s important to anticipate and handle exceptions that might occur during the execution of your program. This can be done using try/except blocks, which allow you to catch exceptions and define how your program should respond to them. This way, even if an error occurs, your program can continue running or fail gracefully."

    "3.n Python, the try, except, else, and finally statements are used to catch and handle exceptions. Here’s how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "try: This block contains the code that might raise an exception. If an exception does occur, the rest of the try block is skipped and the except block is executed.\n",
