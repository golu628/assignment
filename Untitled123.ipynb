        "\n",
        " 1. Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential information to the user.\n",
        " 2. Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods (behavior) that operate on that data within a class, and controlling access to them.\n",
        " 3. Inheritance: Creating new classes (derived classes) from existing classes (base classes), inheriting their attributes and methods.\n",
        "  4. Polymorphism: The ability of an object to take on many forms, allowing methods to be used with objects of different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Q3. __init__() function\n",
        "\n",
        " The __init__() function (also called the constructor) is a special method in Python classes that is automatically called when an object of the class is created. It's used to initialize the object's attributes (data).\n",

        " Q4. Why self is used\n",
        "\n",
        "ans- `self` is a convention (though strongly recommended) in Python used to refer to the instance of the class within the class methods. When you call a method on an object, Python implicitly passes the object itself as the first argument to the method.  `self` is used to access and modify the object's attributes.\n",

        " Q5. Inheritance and its types\n",
        "\n",
        " Inheritance allows you to create new classes (derived classes or subclasses) that inherit attributes and methods from existing classes (base classes or superclasses). This promotes code reuse and creates a hierarchy of classes.\n",
