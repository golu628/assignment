        "\n",
        "Artificial Intelligence (AI): The broader field encompassing the creation of intelligent agents, which are systems that can reason, learn, and act autonomously. ML and DL are techniques used to achieve AI.\n",
        "Machine Learning (ML): A subfield of AI that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms improve their performance over time by identifying patterns and making data-driven predictions.\n",
        "Deep Learning (DL): A subfield of ML inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. DL utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers to process complex data, such as images, text, and speech.\n",
        "Q2. Supervised Learning:\n",
        "\n",
        "Supervised learning involves training a model using labeled data, where each data point has a corresponding output value (label). The model learns the relationship between inputs and outputs and can then be used to predict the output for new, unseen data.\n",

        "Examples of Supervised Learning:\n",
        "\n",
        "Classification: Predicting a category (e.g., spam or not spam for emails, cat or dog for images)\n",
        "Regression: Predicting a continuous value (e.g., stock prices, housing prices)\n",
        "Q3. Unsupervised Learning:\n",
        "\n",
        "Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, where the data points lack predefined labels or categories. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns or structures within the data.\n",

        "\n",
        "In machine learning, it's crucial to split your data into three sets:\n",

        "Train Set: The majority of the data (typically 60-80%) used to train the model. The model learns patterns from this data.\n",
        "Test Set: A held-out portion of the data (usually 20-40%) used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. This helps assess how well the model generalizes to new data.\n",
        "Validation Set (Optional): Sometimes used to fine-tune hyperparameters (model settings) before evaluating on the final test set. It can help prevent overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.\n",
