        "\n",
        "ANOVA relies on several assumptions for accurate results:\n",
        "\n",
        "Normality of Residuals: The errors (residuals) should be normally distributed. Violations can occur due to skewed data or outliers.\n",
        "Homogeneity of Variances: The variances of the groups being compared should be equal. Heteroscedasticity (unequal variances) can lead to inflated Type I error rates.\n",
        "Independence of Errors: Observations within and between groups should be independent. Dependence (e.g., repeated measures on the same subjects) requires specific ANOVA variations.\n",
        "Q2. Types of ANOVA\n",
        "\n",
        "One-Way ANOVA: Compares means across one independent variable (factor) with two or more levels (groups).\n",
        "Two-Way ANOVA: Analyzes the effects of two independent variables on a dependent variable.\n",
        "Repeated Measures ANOVA: Assesses the impact of a single independent variable with multiple levels measured on the same subjects.\n",

        "\n",
        "ANOVA partitions the total variance (SST) into two components:\n",
        "\n",

        "Residual Sum of Squares (SSR): Reflects the unexplained variance due to error or random factors.\n",
