This is particularly useful when working with machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the input data.\n",

        "Rescale Features: Apply a linear transformation to each data point in the feature such that the minimum value in the feature becomes the new minimum value (typically 0) and the maximum value becomes the new maximum value (typically 1).\n",
        "Here's the formula for Min-Max scaling:\n",
        "\n",
        "scaled_value = (original_value - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you have a dataset containing information about houses, including features like \"price\" (in millions) and \"living area\" (in square feet). The price ranges from $0.5 million to $5 million, and the living area ranges from 1000 sq ft to 4000 sq ft.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you train a machine learning model on this data without scaling, the model might give more weight to the \"price\" feature because its values are much larger. This can lead to inaccurate predictions.\n",
        "By applying Min-Max scaling, both \"price\" and \"living area\" will be transformed to a range between 0 and 1, ensuring the model treats each feature more equally.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, a house with a price of $2 million would be scaled to:\n",
        "\n",
        "scaled_price = (2 - 0.5) / (5 - 0.5) = 0.3\n",

It helps improve the performance of machine learning models by addressing the issue of features having different scales. However, it's important to be aware of its limitations, such as sensitivity to outliers."

        "Focus: Min-Max scaling focuses on individual features and their ranges. The Unit Vector technique focuses on the entire data point and its distance from the origin.\n",
        "Resulting Range: Min-Max scaling typically transforms features to a range between 0 and 1 (or a user-defined range). The Unit Vector technique transforms each data point to have a magnitude of 1, but individual features can have any value.\n",

        "Scaled Age (Point 1): 30 / 58.3 = 0.51\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, both data points have a magnitude of 1, but individual feature values differ compared to Min-Max scaling.\n",

        "Applications of Unit Vector Technique:\n",

This approach can be valuable in specific scenarios where the direction and relationships between data points hold more significance than the individual feature values."
